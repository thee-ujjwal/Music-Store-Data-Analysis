# Music-Store-Data-Analysis
The Music Store Data Analysis project is a SQL-based project that aims to analyze the sales and customer data of a fictional music store. The project involves creating and querying a relational database that contains information about the store's employees, customers, invoices, tracks, etc. The project also requires writing complex SQL queries using joins, subqueries, CTE, etc., to answer various business questions, such as finding the best-selling genres, calculating the total sales by country, and identifying the most profitable customers.

The schema diagrama for the database is given below.
